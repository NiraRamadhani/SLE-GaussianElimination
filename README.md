A program to calculate the Linear Equation System solution numerically in the Java programming language using the Gauss and / or Gauss-Jordan elimination method. The Linear Equation System can have unique solutions, many solutions, or no solutions. The Linear Equation System is also used in determining the interpolation polynomial equation. Because the calculation uses the representation of floating point numbers on a computer, then to use calculation errors, pivoting strategies are used to select the rows that are used as the basis for elementary line operations.
